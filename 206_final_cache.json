The mob threw rocks, broke windows, and slashed the tires of the bus. Following police intervention the bus was able to depart for Birmingham, with the mob in pursuit. The former bus station is not currently open to the public. Today, the side of the adjacent building that borders the bus station\u2019s driveway features a mural and educational panels about the events of May 14, 1961.\n\nBus Burning Site (Old Birmingham Highway/State Route 202) At this site, about six miles outside Anniston, the slashed tires of the Greyhound bus gave out and the driver was forced to pull over.

Joseph \u201cLittle Joe\u201d Postiglione, a freelance photographer, captured the scene. Little Joe\u2019s photographs of the burning bus\u2014which appeared in hundreds of newspapers on Monday morning\u2014became iconic images of the civil rights movement.

A jacket is recommended during the winter. Because of the stairs and a ladder, it is recommended that you not wear loose fitting or high-heeled shoes.\nPets - Pets on a 6-foot leash are welcome in the park including on the beach and on the trails. Pets, except for service animals, are not allowed in the visitor center, on the boat, or at the fort. Please clean up after your pet. Do not leave your pet in your vehicle as temperatures can rise quickly.\nParking - While there is usually ample parking for visitors, the parking lot often fills up on weekends, and RV parking is limited.\nAccessibility/Special Needs - The Visitor Center, restrooms, dock, nature trail are wheelchair accessible.

After it was closed a large number of the buildings were removed for various uses, including housing, migrant labor camps, meeting halls or for salvage value.  The land was divided into small farms.  Forty-three of these small farms were allotted in 1947 to World War II veterans, whose names were drawn in a lottery.  In 1949 another 46 small farms were allotted.  Each veteran also received two barracks. Therefore, not much remains of the camp to help visitors understand the important story that happened there.\nToday there is a small gravel parking area, a 1.6 mile walking trail, and interpretative signs about this important time in out history.  The Honor Roll was reconstructed to highlight the nearly 1,000 from Minidoka who served in the war.

The Noatak River offers spectacular wilderness float trip opportunities - from deep in the Brooks Range to the tidewater of the Chukchi Sea. The 400-mile river - a Wild and Scenic River - is virtually unchanged by the humans who have lived in the valley for the last 11,000 years.\nThe national preserve lies almost completely enclosed by the Baird and De Long mountains of the Brooks Range.

Your possibilities here are vast. Whether relaxing on a weeklong raft trip, photographing wildflowers, thrilling your senses on a scenic flight, camping, or charting your own backcountry trek, the country is ready for those willing and prepared to enter it. Whatever adventure you choose, please remember to leave cultural artifacts and natural features as you find them for others to enjoy.\nAccess and services here are limited when compared to traditional National Parks you may have visited elsewhere. What the area may lack in services, it more than makes up for in friendly people and an un-crowded wilderness experience.\nYou'll find no roads, no gift ships, and no parking facilities within the preserve. Trails don't exist; neither do campgrounds. Not even the park headquarters or visitor center are within the preserve. Both facilities are in Kotzebue, Alaska - an airplane ride away.\nNoatak's visitor isn't your average tourist.

Winter visits are recommended only to outdoorspeople experienced in arctic camping and survival techniques. The ranger staff can provide valuable information on conditions and logistics for first time travelers.\nLicensed operators offer various services such as air taxi, guided rafting and hunting.

The property, owned by Metroparks of the Toledo Area, is bounded on the east by Interstate 475, on the south by US Highway 24, on the west by a proposed retail/commercial development, and on the north by additional com-mercial property. A railroad spur cuts through the northwest corner of the battlefield. The property is generally flat, with a small swale in the woods on the south edge of the site and terminating at US 24.\nThe site formerly thought to be the location of the battlefield, 0.25 mile south of the actual site and on the floodplain along the Maumee River, was included in the 1959 National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings as one of 22 sites representing the national historic theme \"The Advance of the Frontier, 1763-1830.\" It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, signifying \"the culminating event which demonstrated the tenacity of the American people in their efforts of western expansion through the struggle for dominance in the Old Northwest Territory.\" The National Historic Landmark designation is being corrected to identify the actual battle site. The battlefield is not yet open to the public.\nFallen Timbers Monument\nThe Fallen Timbers State Monument is a 9-acre site approximately 0.25 mile south of the battlefield. Listed as a National Historic Landmark, the monument is owned by the Ohio Historical Society and is managed by Metroparks of the toledo Area through an agreement.\nMonuments to the battle include the following:\n\u2022 A 10-foot bronze statue of General Wayne, with an Indian guide to the right and a settler to the left, which is mounted on a 15-foot granite pedestal - As a National Historic Landmark, the monument has been found to possess exceptional value in commemorat-ing and illustrating the history of the United States.\n\u2022 Two stone markers in front of the monument - One recognizes U.S. troops killed and wounded in the battle, and the other memorializes the Indian casualties.\n\u2022 Turkeyfoot Rock - The rock is linked by Indian histories to the battle and was moved to the monument site in 1953 from its original location along the Maumee River. Based on conversations with representatives of the American Indian Intertribal Association, some individuals and groups continue to use Turkeyfoot Rock as the site of offerings and ceremonies.\nThe state monument is a fairly level site some 50 feet above the Maumee River floodplain. Visitors have an unobstructed view to the Maumee River, and this important natural corridor has not changed significantly since the time of the battle, showing visitors the ultimate prize of the battle - control of transportation and access along the Maumee River. \nFort Miamis\nThe British fort, located several miles away on River Road, played a role in the Battle of Fallen Timbers and, later, the War of 1812. The park is open, and much of the earthworks used to create the fort are still visible. Archeological remains at the fort are available for future study and interpretation.\nFort Miamis is in a Maumee residential area approximately 5 miles east of the battlefield and memorial. The south side of the fort falls off steeply to the Maumee River. The fort was previously owned and managed by the City of Maumee, but on November 7, 2005, the City Council voted to return ownership to Metroparks of the Toledo Area.", "n": "Fallen Timbers Battlefield and Fort Miamis", "a": "Metroparks of the Toledo Area 5100 W.

Thomas Stone National Historic Site brings visitors together at Haberdeventure, home of an American Revolutionary and signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nWhile few people know who Thomas Stone was, almost every American understands the importance of his legacy. Although Stone was a reluctant Revolutionary who favored diplomacy over war, he ultimately preferred war to surrendering the freedoms he felt the Colonists deserved. Because men like Stone were willing to take a stand, they changed the course of history and laid the groundwork for the liberties we enjoy today.\n\nHere, at Thomas Stone National Historic Site, visitors have an opportunity to connect with our nation's history in a peaceful, rural setting that's a world away from the hustle of nearby towns and cities. Take a tour of Stone's mansion, then stroll one of the park's trails, and immerse yourself in the quiet beauty of nature. There are  many opportunities here for learning, having fun or just relaxing.

The site is furnished to the 1840s era, but the story told here encompasses three decades of American history. From 1842-53, it was a military fort established to protect the Permanent Indian Frontier; soldiers kept peace between white settlers and American Indian tribes, patrolled overland trails and fought in the Mexican-American War. The fort was abandoned in 1853 as the frontier spread further westward. Two years later, the buildings were sold at auction and the fort became a town. The town was involved in the Bleeding Kansas era from 1854-61 when Kansans fought each other over the issue of slavery. There were episodes of violence and intrigue on the grounds of Fort Scott NHS during that era. During the Civil War, the United States Army returned to Fort Scott and established a military base that included many of the former fort buildings. Civil War Fort Scott functioned as a Union supply base, hospital complex, training ground and recruitment center\nThe site is open daily for self guided tours through the buildings. Visitors enter through the visitor center where they are oriented to the site, given safety information and provided with a park brochure.

In downtown Beaufort the monument includes the Old Beaufort Firehouse within the Beaufort National Historic Landmark District, and in Port Royal it includes historic Camp Saxton on U.S. Navy property. The National Park Service does not yet have visitor facilities or services in these locations.\nSt. Helena Island\nDarrah Hall and Brick Baptist Church - Both of these buildings are part of the Penn School National Historic Landmark District. Northern missionaries established the Penn School in 1862 as one of the first schools founded to educate newly freed slaves. The school became a model to illustrate the development of African American educational institutions in the Reconstruction Era. Neither the Brick Baptist Church nor Darrah Hall is open to the public at this time, but you may tour the nearby Penn Center museum. Once repairs and restoration activities are complete, Darrah Hall would likely open to the public for visitor services.\nPort Royal \nCamp Saxton - The 1st South Carolina Volunteers, the first black regiment mustered into regular service in the United States Army during the Civil War, occupied this camp from early November 1862 to late January 1863. This camp was also the site of elaborate ceremonies held on New Year\u2019s Day 1863, which formally announced and celebrated the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves in states then \u201cin rebellion\u201d against the United States. Camp Saxton is located on land that was formerly the John Joyner Smith Plantation, and is now part of Naval Support Facility Beaufort in Port Royal. This site is not accessible to the public at this time.\nDowntown Beaufort\nOld Beaufort Firehouse (706 Craven Street) - This building is centrally located within the Beaufort National Historic Landmark District, a roughly 304 acre district in the City of Beaufort that includes many places and historic properties associated with the Reconstruction Era. The National Park Service plans to develop this building into a visitor facility, but it is currently not open to the public. \nVisitors may learn about the Reconstruction Era at related sites:\nPenn Center - Penn Center is a cultural and educational center located on St. Helena Island. It evolved from the Penn School, one of the first southern schools organized by northern missionaries for emancipated slaves. During the modern civil rights movement Penn School became a site where the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) conducted its Citizenship Education Program. During the 1960s, Penn Center hosted Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the SCLC staff as they planned the March on Washington and the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. For more information: Click Here\nBeaufort History Museum - This museum gives visitors a chance to learn about the important role that Beaufort has played in American history.  The Beaufort History Museum is located in the historic Arsenal, which was built in 1852. During Reconstruction it was home to militia units including African American troops.  The Arsenal was the first voting station in Beaufort County during Reconstruction and was also used by the Freedman Bureau for storage and supplies for the formerly enslaved African Americans. The Beaufort History Museum is located at 713 Craven Street, Beaufort, SC 29902. For more information: Click Here\nMitchelville - Perhaps the first freedmen\u2019s town established during the Civil War, Mitchelville was laid out by the Union army on nearby Hilton Head Island to accommodate freed slaves. The town had a population of about 1,500 in 1862. Civil War photographs and illustrations of the town show a wide variety of building types and activities. Parts of Mitchelville are preserved as a public park and interpreted for visitors. For more information: Click Here\nFort Howell - The Fort Howell site is an earthen fort constructed next to the Mitchelville settlement to protect freed slaves from recapture by Confederate troops. The fort was manned primarily by African American soldiers. Fort Howell was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 and today is a public park with interpretive signage (160 Beach City Rd, Hilton Head Island, SC 29926).\nDirections & Transportation\nGetting to the monument\nThings to Do\nExplore the monument and the area surrounding it.\nCalendar\nSpecial Programs and Events.\nSafety\nWhat to know before you visit.\nAccessibility\nGetting around the site.", "n": "Reconstruction Era", "a": "South Carolina", "hf": false, "pt": "National Monument"}, "https://www.nps.gov/dino/_data": {"ph": "(435) 781-7700", "s": "CO, UT", "pl": "Come Discover Dinosaur!\nMost people come to see dinosaur fossils and there are 1,500 bones of these amazing creatures still encased in the rock at the Dinosaur Quarry Exhibit Hall.

National Park Service\nIn recommending creation of the park, both House and Senate military affairs committees pointed out that probably no other field in the world presented more formidable natural obstacles to large scale military operations than the slopes of Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge. Since the purpose would be to maintain the park in its historic condition, they also noted that there had been scarcely any changes in the roads, fields, forests, and houses at Chickamauga since the battle, except in the growth of underbrush and timber, which could easily be removed. Taken together, these battlefields offered unparalleled opportunities for historical and professional military study of the operations of two great armies as they both encountered the multiple military obstacles created by forests, steep mountains, open fields, and streams. From strategically placed observation towers placed on the Chickamauga Battlefield, Missionary Ridge, and Lookout Mountain, observers and students could comprehend the grand campaign that extended over a 150 mile front and follow many tactical details of the actual battle. No battlefield park of this quality and magnitude could be found in any other location in the world.\nChickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was officially dedicated on September 18-20, 1895. Most of the 1,400 monuments and historical markers on the battlefields were planned and placed by Boynton and other veterans of the battles, under the supervision of the War Department, which administered all national military parks until they were transferred to the National Park Service in 1933.\nEfforts continue today to protect and preserve the park\u2019s many cultural and natural features while providing an inspiring experience for visitors.\nWe look forward to your visit.", "n": "Chickamauga & Chattanooga", "a": "3370 LaFayette Road   Fort Oglethorpe, GA 30742", "hf": true, "pt": "National Military Park"}, "https://www.nps.gov/anac/_data": {"ph": "(202) 472-3884", "s": "District of Columbia", "pl": "Anacostia Park is the free national park in your backyard with year-round opportunities for everyone. \nGet here!

Close to the California mainland, yet worlds apart, the park encompasses five of the eight California Channel Islands (Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara) and their ocean environment, preserving and protecting a wealth of natural and cultural resources. The park bridges two biogeographical provinces and in a remarkably small place, harbors the biologic diversity of nearly 2,500 miles of the North American coast. The Channel Islands are home to over 2,000 plant and animal species, of which 145 are found nowhere else in the world.\nLike the Galapagos Islands of South America, isolation has allowed evolution to proceed independently on the islands. Marine life ranges from microscopic plankton to the blue whale, the largest animal to live on Earth. Archeological and cultural resources span a period of more than 13,000 years of human habitation.\nThe protection of these fragile island resources was ensured when Congress, in the act that created Channel Islands National Park in 1980, established a long-term ecological monitoring program to gather information on the current health of resources and predict future conditions. This information provides park and natural resource managers with useful products for recreation planning, conservation and restoration programs, and early identification of critical issues.\nThe islands were set aside by Congress not only to preserve these resources, but also to provide for your enjoyment. If you visit the park, you will be one of a very select group. Few people actually see this park because it is not easy to get to-you can't drive to the islands. A short but exciting ocean voyage or a commercial flight in a small airplane is required. The park is one of the least visited of all of America's national parks. The relatively light visitation enhances the islands' feeling of solitude and assists in the protection of fragile resources. In establishing the park, Congress recognized the value of solitude by allowing for low intensity, limited entry visitation. So a visit to this national park will always provide a marked contrast to the bustle of southern California most people experience. It will always be a place where you can step back in time and experience coastal southern California the way it once was.\nWe are delighted you are interested in this marvelous place. Thanks for making the effort! We hope our park website encourages you to safely explore and discover Channel Islands National Park while taking care to protect and keep these beautiful and fragile islands unimpaired for future generations.\nRussell E.

Although the park has several Colonial Revival structures that were built  in the 1930s, the house in which Washington was born was destroyed by fire in 1779. The essence of George Washington's story at this site, however, does not reside in wood and brick. The real story is in the landscape, which forever shaped Washington's life. It was here he took his first steps, here he began to learn the rhythms of the natural world and here he began to develop a deep, life-long connection to the land.\nFrom the regional landscape sprang the culture which shaped Washington's values and character. Comprised entirely of large plantation owners, the Tidewater Aristocracy dominated the affairs of the area and perpetuated a code of decorum to which Washington faithfully adhered and exemplified his entire life.\nMost importantly, the landscape here is a living memorial. It is a tangible connection to an extraordinary man whose strength of character, steady leadership and dedication to public service irrevocably shaped our nation.\nThe rich landscape that attracted Washington's great-grandfather to settle here in 1657 is still as abundant in resources today as it was then.

Check out our list of seasonal highlights.\nPlan ahead: campgrounds and lodges fill early, so finding a place to sleep at the last minute is unlikely. \nStay on boardwalks: hot springs have injured more people than any other natural feature (including animals).\nDrive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to watch wildlife, take pictures, and let other cars pass.\nBears inhabit the entire park, not just the backcountry: learn how to travel safely in bear country.\nCell service and bandwidth are limited: don't be surprised if you can't receive calls or texts.\nExplore beyond our borders: the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem includes much more than the park.

However, visitors who wish to enter the museum, pedestal, or crown must secure reservations.  For over a decade, the National Park Service has implemented a reservation system. This is very different from the way past generations once accessed the Statue of Liberty. The National Park Service strongly recommends making advanced ticket reservations. Reservations secured far enough in advance allow visitors to select their desired level of access, and also eliminates the need to wait in line to purchase tickets. Crown tickets are available by advanced reservation only. \nDISCOVER THE TYPES OF TICKETS\nGROUNDS ONLY: This ticket is our most widely available ticket. It gives general public access to the island, and it is the only ticket that is distributed when reservations are full. You will not have access to the interior of the statue's pedestal.  Other activities are available on Liberty Island. Check our Things to Do page.\nFor more information and photos, see our Facebook \"Grounds Only\" Album.\nPEDESTAL TICKET: Pedestal tickets allow visitors to access the inside of the pedestal, museum, and the Fort Wood level. Pedestal tickets are limited, and the National Park Service highly recommends advanced reservations. A limited number of pedestal tickets are available each morning at the ticket office locations, but these are often distributed before the first ferry departure.\nFor more information, see our Visiting the Pedestal information page.\nCROWN TICKET: Crown tickets allow visitors to access the crown, the pedestal, the museum, and the Fort Wood level. Crown tickets are limited, and advanced reservations are required.
